<h2>Favorite Albums & Reviews</h2>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>Parachutes</strong></dt>
	<dd>What I really liked about this album were songs like 
"Yellow" and "Sparks", which were some of the most soothing songs
 to vibe out to.</dd>
	
	<dt><strong>A Head Full of Dreams</strong></dt>
	<dd>This album contained various hits, but my favorite has
 to be "Adventure of a Lifetime" soley because of how well the 
 vocals and instruments blended together, making it something 
much more upbeat and pleasant to listen to.</dd>

	<dt><strong>Ghost Stories</strong></dt>
	<dd>In all honesty, the songs from this album are pretty
 good, but the only song I keep downloaded is "A Sky Full of Stars
". Its mix of upbeat tempo and slow pace are what make me play this
song on repeat from time to time.</dd>
